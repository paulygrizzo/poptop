## 5. Trademark Update & Decision (5 min)
**Lead: Paul**

Quick update: Jeff Johnson (IP Law USA) completed a professional trademark search in April 2025.

**His findings:**

- **His recommendation: proceed with filing**
- **Cost: $1,300** (includes gov fees for 1 class; $350/class extra if USPTO requires additional)

**Status:** Jeff's firm has been waiting since June 2025 for our go-ahead to file.

**Decision needed:** Do we authorize Jeff to file the POPTOP trademark? ($1,300)
