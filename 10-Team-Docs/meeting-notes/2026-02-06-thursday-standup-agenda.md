## 5. Trademark Update & Decision (5 min)
**Lead: Paul**

Quick update: Jeff Johnson (IP Law USA) completed a professional trademark search in April 2025.

**His findings:**
- Two potentially relevant marks found ("Pop Top" Class 21 water bottles, "Top Pop" Class 32 soft drinks)
- **Neither is a showstopper** -- our goods/services are reasonably different
- **His recommendation: proceed with filing**
- **Cost: $1,300** (includes gov fees for 1 class; $350/class extra if USPTO requires additional)
