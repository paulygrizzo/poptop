## Phase 0: Reboot & Foundation (Feb 4 - Feb 14, 2026)
**Owner: Paul Giarrizzo**
**Goal: Get the team re-aligned, infrastructure live, and foundation set for execution.**

### 0.1 Team Realignment
| Task | Owner | Status | Target |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| Thursday standing call (reboot) | Paul | Scheduled | Feb 6 |
| Confirm team commitment (all members) | Paul | Pending | Feb 13 |
| Brian: sign royalty agreement | Paul + Brian | Pending | Feb 13 |
| Alex: confirm capital for Phase 1-2 | Paul + Alex | Pending | Feb 13 |
| Contact Ross -- update & re-engage | Paul | Pending | Feb 8 |
| Establish recurring Thursday call | Paul | Pending | Feb 6 |
| Set up team communication channel | Whitney / Paul | Pending | Feb 13 |

### 0.2 Project Infrastructure
| Task | Owner | Status | Target |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| Deploy Google Sheets Command Center | Paul | **COMPLETE** | Feb 4 |
| Share dashboard + docs with team | Paul | Pending | Feb 8 |

### 0.3 Brand Protection (Quick Wins)
| Task | Owner | Status | Target |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| USPTO trademark search for "PopTop" | Paul | **COMPLETE** | Feb 3 |
| Check domain availability | Paul | **COMPLETE** | Feb 3 |
| Professional attorney trademark search | Jeff Johnson | **COMPLETE** | Apr 28, 2025 |
| Attorney recommendation: proceed | Jeff Johnson | **COMPLETE** | Apr 28, 2025 |
| Authorize Jeff Johnson to file trademark ($1,300) | Paul + Alex | **DECISION NEEDED** | Feb 6 call |
| Register best available domain (drinkpoptop.com or getpoptop.com) | Alex | Pending | Feb 10 |
| Secure social media handles (matching domain) | Whitney / Paul | Pending | Feb 17 |

#### Trademark Status Update (Feb 2026)
> **Attorney Search (Apr 2025):** Jeff Johnson (IP Law USA) completed a federal trademark search. Found the same two potentially relevant marks:
> 1. **"Pop Top" (Class 21)** -- reusable plastic water bottles (Cameron Bishop, Serial No. 87271968)
> 2. **"Top Pop" (Class 32)** -- carbonated soft drinks
>
> **Attorney Recommendation: PROCEED.** Neither mark is a showstopper. PopTop's goods/services (beverage dispensers) are reasonably different, and the firm would have a reasonable chance to argue against any USPTO rejection.
>
> **Filing Cost:** $1,300 (includes gov fees for 1 class). Additional classes $350 each if USPTO requires. Response filings quoted separately.
>
> **Current Status:** Jeff Johnson's firm is **waiting for the green light** to file. Last contact: June 18, 2025. Paul indicated intent to proceed but never gave final authorization. **Team decision needed on this call.**
>
> **Domain:** poptop.com is parked/for sale (expect premium). drinkpoptop.com and getpoptop.com appear available.
>
> **Social:** @poptop is taken on Instagram, likely taken everywhere. Variants like @drinkpoptop or @getpoptop needed.
>
> See also: Internal research report `02-Legal-IP/trademark-domain-research-2025-02-03.md`

**Phase 0 Gate:** Team committed, dashboard live, standing call running, trademark path clear.

## Critical Dependencies & Risks

### Dependency Chain
```
Team Alignment (Feb 6) → Design Work Starts (Feb 9)
Design Freeze (Apr 24) → Manufacturing RFQ (May) + CLC Submission (May 1)
CLC Submission (May 1) → Approval (6-12 wks, Jun-Jul) → School Licenses (Jul-Aug)
Tooling Deposit (Jun 12) → T1 Samples (Jul 17)
T1 Approval (Jul 24) → Production Run Auth (Jul 31)
Inventory at 3PL (Aug 14) → Soft Launch (Aug 21) → PUBLIC LAUNCH (Sep 1)
```

### Risk Register
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Team disengagement (again) | Medium | Critical | Weekly calls, dashboard visibility, clear ownership |
| CLC approval delays beyond 12 weeks | Low | High | Submit May 1 with complete package; follow up weekly |
| Tooling delays | Medium | High | Start RFQ immediately at design freeze, build in buffer |
| Manufacturing quality issues | Low | High | T1 validation, QC process, backup supplier |
| Capital constraints | Medium | Medium | Phased spending, pre-orders to fund later phases |
| Design iteration overruns | Medium | Medium | Hard design freeze Apr 24, rapid prototyping |
| Trademark conflict (Bishop Class 21 + descriptiveness) | **Low-Medium** | **Medium** | Attorney reviewed, recommends proceeding. Possible USPTO rejection arguable. Awaiting authorization to file. |
| Aggressive timeline slip | Medium | High | Weekly tracking, early escalation, parallel workstreams |
