## TRADEMARK FINDINGS

### Overall Assessment: MODERATE-TO-HIGH RISK

"PopTop" faces two significant challenges for trademark registration in the beverage dispenser / drinkware category:

1. **A direct Class 21 conflict exists**
2. **The term may be considered descriptive/generic by USPTO**

### Descriptiveness / Genericness Risk

"Pop top" is widely used as a generic term in the beverage/container industry:
- Refers to the pull-tab opening on aluminum cans (invented 1959)
- Used descriptively by BurnOut Mugs for their "pop top lid" on tumblers
- Common term for any lid that "pops" open

USPTO may refuse registration under Section 2(e)(1) for being merely descriptive. This is a significant hurdle.

### Recommended Actions

1. **VERIFY** Cameron Bishop filing status at [tsdr.uspto.gov](https://tsdr.uspto.gov) -- Serial No. 87271968
2. **CONSULT** Jeff Johnson (IP attorney) with these findings before filing
3. **DISCUSS** with attorney whether "PopTop" for "beverage dispensers for collegiate tailgating" is sufficiently different from "reusable water bottles"
4. **PREPARE** 2-3 backup name options in case attorney advises against "PopTop"
5. **CONSIDER** whether a stylized/design mark (logo) could strengthen the application vs. a word mark alone
